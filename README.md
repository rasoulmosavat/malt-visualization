Data Visualization of MaLT2’s Users Activities

Computational Thinking becomes a fundamental skill for the 21st century (Yadav et al. 2011)[1]. MaLT (Machine Lab Turtle-sphere) as an online environment that integrates Logo textual programming with the affordances of dynamic manipulation, 3D graphics and camera navigation can promote constructionist learning and lead to the development of Computational Thinking skills along with the generation of meanings about programming concepts(Kynigos 2018)[2].
The purpose of this project is to enhance the MALT2 project and make a visualization tool that will provide teachers with visualized information of student actions. The aims of visualization are to provide an immediate impression of student performance(Valle et al. 2018)[3] and to assist teachers to organize students’ future potential studies in the light of past performance.
